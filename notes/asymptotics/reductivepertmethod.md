# The Reductive Perturbation Method
See [this](https://univ-angers.hal.science/hal-03423758/file/tutorial_hl.pdf) article for information. Need to look into this more, seems a little strange but has seen good results in comparison to experiments. Also provides a good way of analyzing nonlinear wave equations (or nonlinear systems in fluid mechanics like nonlinear dust acoustic waves).
